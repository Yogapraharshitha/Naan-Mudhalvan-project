Abstract:
        This project presents the design and implementation of a noise-robust speech-to-text transcription system aimed at accurately converting spoken language into written text in real-world, noisy environments. Traditional automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems often suffer significant performance degradation when exposed to background noise, limiting their effectiveness in practical applications such as mobile assistants, transcription services, and accessibility tools. To address this challenge, our system integrates advanced noise suppression techniques, robust acoustic modeling using deep learning (e.g., CNNs, RNNs, or Transformers), and data augmentation strategies to simulate diverse acoustic conditions during training. The model is trained and evaluated on both clean and noisy speech datasets, with performance benchmarks compared against standard ASR baselines. Results demonstrate improved transcription accuracy in various noisy scenarios, highlighting the potential of the proposed approach for real-world deployment where background noise is prevalent.
